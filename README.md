# Intro to Python 2

This repo contains the code for UT ASME's second intro to python event.
In it, we will be making a clone of Flappy Bird using Python and Pygame-ce.

The main branch has the up to date, completed code, while the start branch
(default branch on Github) only includes the code to start with while following
along at the event.
